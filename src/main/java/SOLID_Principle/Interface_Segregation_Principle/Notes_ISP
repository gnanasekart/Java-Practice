No Client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

Techniques To identify Violations of ISP

1. Fat Interfaces - Interfaces with high no of methods. Ex- IMultifunction interface

2. Interfaces with Low Cohesion - in this interfaces there are many methods among them scan photo and
fax are two different concept via transmission of info.
This is like low cohesion in high multi function interface.

3. Empty method Implementation - blank interfaces

Comparing the similarity this principle with other SOLID principles
1. Once after separating IMultiFunction, then each interfaces is design on Single responsibility principle.



SOLID Principles complement each other, and work together in unison, to achieve the common purpose
of well-designed software.
