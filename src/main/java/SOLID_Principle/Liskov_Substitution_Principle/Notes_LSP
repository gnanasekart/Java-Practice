Objects should be replaceable with their subtypes without affecting the correctness of the program.

The bird and Car class defines the same problem

LSP applied on this issue and created a new main class as VehicleUtils_LSP
Followed that Vehicle_LSP is base class and remaining two *_LSP classes are subclasses

Solution
- Break the hierarchy if it fails the substitution test.
- Tell don't ask.
