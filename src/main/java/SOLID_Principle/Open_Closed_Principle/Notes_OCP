Software components should be closed for modification, but open for extension.

Closed for Modification means new features getting added to the software component, should NOT have to modify existing code.
Open for Extension means a software component to add a new feature or to add a new behaviour to it.

Key takeaways
1. Easy of adding new features.
2. Leads to minimal cost of developing and testing software.
3. OCP often requires decoupling, which in turn automatically follows the Single Responsibility principle.


SOLID Principles
- Are all intertwined and interdependent.
- Are most effective when they are combined together.
- It is important to get a wholesome view of all the SOLID Principles.

Caution
- Do not follow the OCP blindly.
- You will end up with a huge no of classes that can complicate your overall design.
- Make a subjective, rather than an objective decision.
