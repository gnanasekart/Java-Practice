Every Software component should have one and only one reason to change
- If there are multiple reason to change then the frequency of changes to it will increase.
- Every change to a software component opens up the possibility of introducing bugs into the software.
- the probability of introducing a bug goes up.
- This would require more time and effort to be spent of retesting the software after the changes are made.
- more time & efforts = money
